### Purpose
This repository is part of a larger project exploring how visual attention to labels, influenced by factors like fasting and the saliency of information, affects consumer decision-making processes. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior in the context of nutritional and sustainability labeling.

### Content
**Visualization:** Scripts for creating plots to visualize interaction effects and distributions of dwell times based on salience levels.

**Statistical Analysis:** Conducting various statistical tests (T-Test, Correlation Test, Wilcoxon Test) and building Linear Mixed Models and Zero-Inflated Gamma Models to understand the impact of salience and top-down modulating conditions on dwell time.

**Model Diagnostics:** Code for generating diagnostic plots for model validation.
